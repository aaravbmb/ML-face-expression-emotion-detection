# Facial Expression Emotion Detection System
## Overview
This project work is submitted in the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the certification of **Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning** powered by **IBM**. 

Our aim was to develop a machine learning model that detects facial expressions that can be used by businesses and organizations to understand the employeeâ€™s mental wellbeing while working.

By using the **FER2013 dataset**, we trained a Machine Learning model using Tensorflow, used OpenCV to extract and modify image data and used Google Colaboratory features to implement a real-time face expression detection model that captures each image frame and analyzes for emotion on each frame.
